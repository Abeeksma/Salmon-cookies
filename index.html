            <p>Welcome to Pat's Salmon Cookie store!</p>
            <div>
                <p>Take the ship into the Neutral Zone I can't. As much as I care about you, my first duty is to the ship. I guess it's better to be lucky than good. Then maybe you should consider this: if anything happens to them, Starfleet is going to want a full investigation. The Federation's gone; the Borg is everywhere! I am your worst nightmare! How long can two people talk about nothing? When has justice ever been as simple as a rule book? Maybe we better talk out here; the observation lounge has turned into a swamp.</p>
                <p>Congratulations - you just destroyed the Enterprise. I'll alert the crew. Fate. It protects fools, little children, and ships named "Enterprise." The Enterprise computer system is controlled by three primary main processor cores, cross-linked with a redundant melacortz ramistat, fourteen kiloquad interface modules. The game's not big enough unless it scares you a little. I suggest you drop it, Mr. Data.</p>
                <p>Shields up! Rrrrred alert! Your head is not an artifact! Could someone survive inside a transporter buffer for 75 years? You bet I'm agitated! I may be surrounded by insanity, but I am not insane. Fate protects fools, little children and ships named Enterprise. Yes, absolutely, I do indeed concur, wholeheartedly! Some days you get the bear, and some days the bear gets you. We know you're dealing in stolen ore. But I wanna talk about the assassination attempt on Lieutenant Worf. We finished our first sensor sweep of the neutral zone. But the probability of making a six is no greater than that of rolling a seven.</p>
