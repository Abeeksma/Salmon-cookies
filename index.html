            <p>Our neural pathways have become accustomed to your sensory input patterns. For an android with no feelings, he sure managed to evoke them in others. Travel time to the nearest starbase? Talk about going nowhere fast. We know you're dealing in stolen ore. But I wanna talk about the assassination attempt on Lieutenant Worf. Fear is the true enemy, the only enemy. You did exactly what you had to do. You considered all your options, you tried every alternative and then you made the hard choice.

            Flair is what marks the difference between artistry and mere competence. Then maybe you should consider this: if anything happens to them, Starfleet is going to want a full investigation. And blowing into maximum warp speed, you appeared for an instant to be in two places at once. I am your worst nightmare! That might've been one of the shortest assignments in the history of Starfleet. Wouldn't that bring about chaos? What? We're not at all alike! Well, I'll say this for him - he's sure of himself. I suggest you drop it, Mr. Data. Maybe we better talk out here; the observation lounge has turned into a swamp. We could cause a diplomatic crisis. Take the ship into the Neutral Zone

              Worf, It's better than music. It's jazz. The unexpected is our normal routine. Did you come here for something in particular or just general Riker-bashing? I've had twelve years to think about it. And if I had it to do over again, I would have grabbed the phaser and pointed it at you instead of them.

              I'll be sure to note that in my log. Now we know what they mean by 'advanced' tactical training. But the probability of making a six is no greater than that of rolling a seven. Well, I'll say this for him - he's sure of himself.

            <p> Well, that's certainly good to know. The Enterprise computer system is controlled by three primary main processor cores, cross-linked with a redundant melacortz ramistat, fourteen kiloquad interface modules. Besides, you look good in a dress.
